 *** TODO ***

 I need to read the code carefully. There could be bugs. Also, I
 need to trace it carefully. Look carefully at the point where
 COMPA flag is reset.
- print tasks in the order they will be invoked.
- improve logging by allowing a value to be reported.
- Motor with duty level 0% or 100% could be excluded from the queue.
- Think about a good way to report an error. Right now macro error() reports an error to a serial port.
- Add a function that reports how much time we got before the next task.
- dynamic allocation of tasks.
- in schedule_task(), check if the current position of the task is 
  good, and no reshuffling required.
- Driving motors with 100Hz PWM works just fine with the H-Bridge and
  the motors I have. However playing with these numbers lead to unexpected
  results. For example: period=5000 and step=20 caused a lot of problems.
  Need to play more with these constants. 
- other types of tasks that can be implemented:
    trigger_boolean:
        : period
        : address of a boolean.
    swipe servo
        : pin
        : min angle
        : max angle
        : swing duration
        : pause
        : offset.
    servo motions:
        : pin
        : num_motion_modes ... mode
        : num_motion_phases[mode]... phase
        : position[mode][phase]
        : time[mode][phase]
        : offset
    read_analog:
        : pin
        : id
        : get_task_value(task_id).

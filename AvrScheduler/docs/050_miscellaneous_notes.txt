 
 *** MISCELLANEOUS NOTES ***

 Here I put some miscellaneous notes that might be important, but
 from my personal experience, are not the most interesting thing
 to read for most people who checked out this this library for
 the first time.

 First of all, AvrScheduler is not distributed by any company;
 this is my personal hobby project, I hope there is no confusion
 there. However this library is very specific to AVR and
 has really been only tested on Arduino Uno, so I felt that
 this name is appropriate.

 The other consideration for the name is that, I do not want
 it to collide with the names in your project, so I might
 rename it something like AvsAvrScheduler, where Avs are
 basically random letters (which happened to be my initials),
 which will help avoid name collisions.

 I intend to make this library useful to others in some way,
 but I have not decided yet which license would be the best.
 If you really want to use it in commercial application right
 away please contact me -- but what are the chances of that?
 I will make a decision about licensing soon.

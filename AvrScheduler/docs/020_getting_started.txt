 *** Getting started ***

Basically it is a very simple Arduino project with only a few files.

You will need an Arduino board, and an Arduino IDE which you can get
from https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software.

I am developing this on Linux, so the instructions are for Linux.
Everythig should work exactly the same on OSX. On Windows, the
commands would be slightely different, but it should not be hard
to figuring out what needs to be done.


After you checkout the Git repositiory, changed the directory

$ cd AvrScheduler

and run the script

$ ./make_links2.sh

This script creates hard links for each file in AvrScheduler2 in
an each test directory: 010_test_one_thread, 020_test_three_threads,
025_test_trigger, et c.

This is done because Arduino IDE does not seem to like soft links.
Also note, that not all file systems support hard links apparantly.

If you have problems creating these hard links, you can copy over
the files manually. You would copy those files in your project.

I recommend to start with 010_test_one_thread.  Open the
direcotry with Arduino IDE, compile and load it to the board.
Open the "Serial Monitor", you should see the board sending
you gritting messages:

Time: 262. Hello!
Time: 499. Hello!
Time: 999. Hello!
Time: 1499. Hello!
Time: 1999. Hello!
Time: 2499. Hello!
....

Congradulations, you are through with the hard part! Now you
checkout the other tests.  These tests can be run if all you have
is just a board: 020_test_three_threads, 025_test_trigger. The
other tests would require to have servos, or a motor with an
H-Bridge.
